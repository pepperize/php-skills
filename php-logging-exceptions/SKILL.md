# PHP Logging And Exceptions

## Logging

Do not hide domain-relevant logging in helper methods such as `getXOrWarn(...)`.

Log where the problem is detected so the log points to the real origin.

## Log Safety Review

Before finalizing logging changes:

- Keep log calls where the failure or skip decision is made.
- Extract collaborators only for formatting, encoding, mapping, or classification, not to hide domain-relevant logging.
- Treat external data, exception values, validation paths, and rejected values as unsafe before logging.
- Encode unsafe log values at the last formatting boundary before they are passed to the logger.
- Do not pass raw dynamic values into logger placeholders or concatenated log messages when the value may come from requests, persisted data, external systems, files, config, generated URLs, S3 keys, exception messages, or validation failures. Validate inputs at the boundary where feasible, but also encode unsafe log values at the final logging boundary with a project-approved `encode...ForLog` helper. Keep the original value for domain, storage, and API behavior; only encode the value passed to the logger. Keep exceptions unencoded and pass them through the logger's established exception mechanism.
- When adding a reusable log encoder, cover CR, LF, CRLF, tabs, quotes, and script-like payloads in focused unit tests.
- Name extracted log-formatting methods with verb phrases such as `format...`, `encode...`, or `create...`.

## Exceptions

Throw exceptions where the problem originates.

Avoid helper or factory methods that throw internally when the caller is the place that understands the failed invariant or boundary condition.

Do not add application exceptions only to translate malformed HTTP requests into HTTP responses. Throw or map API-boundary client errors in the controller or API adapter.

## Exception Boundaries

- Do not catch broad `Throwable` in orchestration code just to log and convert it into `null`, an empty array, or a generic failure result.
- Only catch exceptions when the collaborator documents or clearly owns a recoverable failure case that the caller can handle meaningfully.
- If a method only filters or maps already-loaded data, "no matches" should be a normal empty result, not an exception path.
- Do not branch on human-readable exception or HTTP error message text for control flow. Classify external API failures using stable contract signals such as HTTP status, documented machine-readable error codes, typed exceptions, or structured response fields. If a status code has multiple business meanings, clarify or improve the upstream contract instead of matching message text.
